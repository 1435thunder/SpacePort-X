## 🚀 Module: Orbital Slingshot Logistics (OSL) for Moonbase Alpha

### Overview

Orbital Slingshot Logistics (OSL) is an autonomous, propellant-minimal delivery system for lunar surface operations. Leveraging the centrifugal launch capability of **SpacePort X**, payloads are launched into lunar transfer trajectories using tethered ring acceleration and arrive via AI-guided soft-landing capsules.

### 🌐 System Flow

1. **Cargo & fuel are loaded into AI-guided capsules** aboard SpacePort X.
2. **Centrifugal launch ring** slings the capsule into a calculated lunar transfer arc.
3. **Mid-flight**:
   - Capsule coasts in vacuum
   - Performs low-energy Δv corrections using cold-gas or electric thrusters
4. **Approach**:
   - Capsule enters lunar orbit or direct descent
   - AI adjusts entry for precision landing or soft crash with retrievable cargo
5. **Lunar Recovery Teams or Bots** collect, deploy, or recycle delivered systems.

### 🧱 Payload Capsule Design

| Feature                   | Description                                                   |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Inflatable Aeroshell**  | Mars-style shock-absorbing skin; crushable or deployable     |
| **Cold Gas Thrusters**    | Used only for mid-course correction & descent burn           |
| **Onboard AI Navigation** | Determines attitude, velocity, and target on lunar approach  |
| **RF Locator Beacon**     | Assists with surface recovery and tracking                    |
| **Optional Solar Panels** | For multi-day survival or sensor probe mode                  |

### 📦 Delivery Configurations

| Type           | Mass Range    | Use Case                             |
|----------------|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| **MicroCapsule** | 50–100 kg     | Medical, comms, tools for explorers   |
| **Lunar Barrel** | 250 kg        | Water, O₂, solar cells, small robots  |
| **BrickPod**     | 500–1000 kg   | Structural components, habitat parts  |
| **SeedProbe**    | 20 kg         | Geo-survey bots, sample drills        |

### 🧠 AI Tasks

- Autonomous trajectory correction mid-flight
- Lunar terrain mapping during approach
- Retropack timing for soft impact or landing
- Collision avoidance (in swarm drops)
- Beacon triangulation for final target approach

### ⚙️ Advantages

- ✅ **No propellant** needed for launch
- ✅ **Continuous cargo stream** from orbit to surface
- ✅ **Cheaper, lighter, and scalable**
- ✅ Avoids Earth launch windows entirely
- ✅ Compatible with robotic recovery & assembly systems

### 🔥 Bonus Mode: Swarm Drop Tactics

- Launch **dozens or hundreds** of capsules in formation
- Create **solar farms**, antenna arrays, or **modular base zones**
- Pre-deploy repair bots, regolith printers, or rover parts
- Redundancy: if some fail, others complete the mission
