# 🛸 HAULER: Stratospheric Helium-Powered Orbital Launch Platform

**A zero-fuel, helium-lifted solar aircraft for safe, scalable human transport to orbit.**

---

## 🎯 Mission Summary

HAULER is a helium-assisted, solar-powered aircraft designed to lift 100–200 humans into the stratosphere for safe orbital rendezvous with reusable shuttles such as SpaceX Starship. By separating high-risk launch stacks from human transport, HAULER mitigates catastrophic loss and enables mass migration to orbit.

## 🧠 System Roles

| Function                  | Benefit |
|---------------------------|---------|
| **Safe crew transport**   | Separate from launch risks, no proximity to volatile fuels |
| **Reusable lifter**       | Returns to ground autonomously after every mission |
| **Helium cell insulation**| Adds thermal buffering and passive stability |
| **Solar redundancy**      | Clean energy cycle, no cryo tanks or combustion risk |
| **Tourism & training**    | Adaptable for civilian orbit rides, low-G simulation, or training labs |

## 🪐 Flight Sequence

1. **Crew Boarding** at terrestrial airport or solar launch facility
2. **Ascent** powered by solar-electric lift and passive helium buoyancy
3. **Cruising Phase** at 40–60 km with orbital telemetry sync
4. **Docking Window**: orbital shuttle connects for crew/cargo transfer
5. **Re-entry Phase**: HAULER glides to controlled landing site for reload

## 🛡️ Safety Profile

| Safety Element         | Purpose |
|------------------------|---------|
| **Helium lift**        | Inert and non-explosive |
| **No onboard fuel**    | Eliminates ignition risk during launch window |
| **Compartmental lift cells** | Prevents catastrophic loss of buoyancy |
| **Redundant control systems** | AI fly-by-wire and re-entry stabilization |
| **Abortability**       | If launch fails, crew glides home safely |
