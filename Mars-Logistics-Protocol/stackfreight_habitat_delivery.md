## 🛰️ StackFreight Habitat Delivery Protocol

### Objective

Deliver pre-built, modular habitats directly to the Martian surface using a modified Starship-style habitat stack system. Each module is self-contained, EDL-ready, and designed to integrate into a larger grid after landing.

### 🚀 System Architecture

| Layer       | Function                                     |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Top Cap     | Balloon array + retro booster + sensors      |
| Habitat Core| Pressurized structure, power, AI, plumbing   |
| Crumple Ring| Shock ring to absorb impact stress           |
| Base Plate  | Retros + deployable landing airbags          |
| Docking Ring| For expansion into colony or MarsNet grid    |

### 🛠️ Deployment Sequence

1. Launch modular habitat stack to SBX via booster  
2. Detach booster, move stack to SBX orbital freighter  
3. Freighter rotates & aligns stack for Mars drop  
4. One-by-one release of modules using smart cradle or rail  
5. Balloons deploy + retros burn for terminal deceleration  
6. Airbags deploy just before touchdown  
7. Upon landing, modules auto-activate and ping base

### 🧱 Post-Landing Actions

- Solar panels unfurl  
- AI boots up  
- Systems stabilize interior environment  
- Drones link modules via smart docking rings  
- Rovers weld or seal connections

### 🧩 Integration Options

| Habitat Use | Module Description |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Living      | Private crew bunks, EVA prep rooms |
| Hydroponics | Low-pressure grow labs with LED panels |
| Storage     | Sealed vaults for gear, bots, and spares |
| Medical     | Radiation-shielded triage + diagnostics |
| Command     | AI node, uplink, data routing hub |

---

### ♻️ Reusability

- Balloon modules float for recovery  
- Cradle frames can be pulled into orbit  
- Habitat ring accepts plug-in expansions
