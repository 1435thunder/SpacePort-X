## 🚚 Bulk Freight Delivery Protocol — Equipment Deployment

### Objective

Deploy non-habitat, high-mass equipment such as rovers, mining rigs, fuel processors, and AI bots to the Martian surface using orbital drop logistics.

### 📦 Equipment Payload Pod Design

| Component       | Description                            |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Frame            | Shock-isolated truss w/ AI node mount |
| Enclosure Shell  | Kevlar-carbon mix shell                |
| Power Pack       | Fold-out solar + backup fuel cell      |
| Payload Cradle   | Suspended AI rover, drone, or drill    |
| Airbags          | Final impact shock absorbers           |
| Top Coupler      | Balloon + retro attachment ring        |

---

### 🪂 Drop Sequence

1. Eject pod from orbital hauler  
2. Balloon system inflates to slow descent  
3. Retro-thrusters activate ~100–200m above ground  
4. Airbags deploy at impact  
5. Landing beacon + solar array activate  
6. Payload AI activates + begins autonomous ops

### 🔧 Supported Equipment Payloads

| Category        | Sample Equipment                   |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Rovers           | Terrain drones, sampling bots       |
| Energy Systems   | Solar farms, methane generators     |
| Infrastructure   | 3D printers, scaffolds, shelters     |
| Robotics         | Fabrication arms, repair units      |
| Comms Relays     | Mesh network towers, beacons        |
| Mining           | Small drills, regolith extractors   |

---

### 📶 Activation + Networking

- All drops form part of **MarsNet** mesh  
- Position triangulated by SBX + AI uplink  
- Networked swarms begin coordinated tasks  

---

### ♻️ Recovery

- Balloon modules detach post-drop  
- Float to collection altitude  
- Retrieved via orbital drones or MarsNet balloon trapper nodes
